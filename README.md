# CIS7-FinalProject
Project : Vigenere Cipher Decryption
This project is related to Cipher and I have createdthe program "Vigenère cipher". Vigenere Cipher is a method encrypting alphabetic text. On a high level it consists of Plain text (to encrypt) and Key.  It’s a complex Polyalphabetic cipher technique. This technique is used to secure data in the form of digital images.

This program is writted in C++, by using Discreate structure concept of Cryptography, and it consists of following functions:
•	Encrypt – To perform encryption of the plaintext. 
•	Decrypt – To decrypt the encrypted string. 
•	GenerateKey – To generate the key to match the length of the plaintext. 
•	GetPlainText – This function gets user input for plaintext, validate it using Regular expression and return to main function.
•	GetKeyword This function gets the user input for Key, validate it using Regular expression and return to main function.
•	ConvertToUpper – This function is to convert the plaintext and key to upper case.
